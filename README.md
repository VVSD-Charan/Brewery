## Brewery

### The "Brewery" project offers users an extensive selection of available drinks, leveraging the CocktailDB API for fetching drink data. React Axios handles the seamless integration of GET and POST requests with the API, while React navigation ensures dynamic website behavior based on the page's state. The project incorporates advanced React concepts such as React routes, useLoaderData, and Outlets, enhancing its functionality. Additionally, React Toastify provides responsive alerts, delivering notifications upon successful or failed form submissions. Wrappers are used to style pages.
